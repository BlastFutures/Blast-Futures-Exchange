# IPoolDeposit Interface Documentation

The `IPoolDeposit` interface defines the structure and events for management of individual and pooled deposits to the `Bfx` exchange contract by a third party. It is designed to facilitate the aggregation of funds from multiple contributors into identifiable pools, as well as handling standalone deposits. 

## Interface Overview

- **License:** MIT
- **Solidity Version:** ^0.8.0

## Structs

### Contribution

Defines a single contribution to a pool, including the contributor's address and the amount contributed.

- **Properties:**
  - `contributor`: Address of the entity making the contribution.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens or currency being contributed.

## Events

### Deposit

Emitted for each individual deposit, whether it is part of a pooled deposit or a standalone contribution.

- **Parameters:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the deposit transaction.
  - `trader`: Address of the contributor or trader making the deposit.
  - `amount`: The amount deposited.
  - `poolId`: Identifier for the pool in the case of a pooled deposit, or 0 for individual deposits.

### PooledDeposit

Emitted to summarize a pooled deposit transaction, indicating the total amount deposited into the pool.

- **Parameters:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the pool.
  - `amount`: Total amount contributed to the pool by all participants.

## Functions

### individualDeposit

Processes an individual deposit, attributing it to a specific contributor and handling the transfer of funds accordingly.

- **Parameters:**
  - `contributor`: Address of the individual making the deposit.
  - `amount`: Amount of the deposit.

### pooledDeposit

Handles deposits from multiple contributors in a single transaction.

- **Parameters:**
  - `contributions`: An array of `Contribution` structs, each representing a single contribution to the pool.

## Usage

Implementers of the `IPoolDeposit` interface are expected to provide mechanisms for receiving, tracking, and possibly reallocating or investing pooled funds based on the defined structure. This interface can be utilized in various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including but not limited to investment pools, crowdfunding platforms, and collective asset management solutions.

## Security Considerations

- Implementations should ensure secure handling of funds to prevent unauthorized access or loss.
- Validation of the contribution amounts and contributor addresses is crucial to maintain the integrity of the deposits and the pool.
- Event logging should accurately reflect the actions taken, providing transparency and traceability for all contributions and pooled funds.
